# Viewing my Websume

I've tested this project to be working at [broekhuyse.github.io/websume](https://broekhuyse.github.io/websume). If for some reason it is not working, my apologies. It can be downloaded as a .zip and executed on local host like this:

1. Download the repo as a .zip
2. Un-zip to a local folder. Use the `npm install` command in the root.
3. Use `ng serve --open` and the project will open in a browser on localhost.
